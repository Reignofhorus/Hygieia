I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.  Check out this site for some help.  I think it boils down to:

git pull origin master				#Pull changes from remote repo
*make changes*
git commit -am "Text about the changes"		#Adds changed(but not new) files to the index(a) and commits to local repo
git push origin master				#Push changes to remote repo
