I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.  Check out this site for some help.  I think it boils down to:

git pull origin master				#Pull changes from remote repo
*make changes*
git commit -am "Text about the changes"		#Adds changed(but not new) files to the index(a) and commits to local repo
git push origin master				#Push changes to remote repo

You'll need python to run the script.  Cody you'll have it by default, but you might need pygame, it's a dependancy.  You should be able to get it from your package repo(ubuntu right?  "sudo aptitude install python-pygame").  Tim if you end up here, you'll have to install python and pygame for Windows.

To run just clone the repo to a local working directory, cd to the dir and run "python main.py".  Should just display a little cherry.
